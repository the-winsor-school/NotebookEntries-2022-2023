9/17/2022,Both,Brainstorming/Researching,"As an entire subteam, we discussed the building brainstorm ideas that we discussed the night before. We starred which ideas we liked the most and then researched them. We also created a design matrix that showed our priorities and their weights. We then made a slideshow on our favorite researched building ideas.  ","Narrowing down research questions and finding suitable resources, as well as documenting ideas completely",prioritize what should be done first and start prototyping,Building subteam,"Building Subteam Brainstorm , Building Brainstorm Whiteboard"
9/23/2022,Both,Detailed Branstorming,"We narrowed our ideas for the two robots and used whiteboards to draw out specific components. We took into account the physics that would affect our robot (center of gravity, torque) and drew diagrams to help us design. Specifically, we drew out the arm and lift and looked at parts that we could possibly prototype with. We also prioritized certain parts of the robot to build. ","We tried to use onshape for CAD, but after some exploration, we figured that we weren't fans of the user interface. Had some problems understanding how the telescoping arm would work.","Still figure out telescoping arm, then start prototyping!","Eleni, Nora, Anita, Ava, Caroline, Maya, Gracie, Anna, Julia, Elyse, Angie","Two robot designs, joint arm, telescoping arm, torque diagram, our priorities"
9/23/2022,Both,Working on Chassis,Disassembled old chassis to re-use motors,"old screws had been assembled with loctite, so we had to use a heat gun to get them loose.",use our now-separated parts to re-assemble into a new chassis!,"Hannah, Alyssa, Aleena, Spencer",
9/30/2022,Both,Working on Vertical Chassis,"We fixed the motors and finished the next steps in building the vertical chassis. Also, all the motors are now attatched.","The size of the shaft in between the adapter and the motor did not work, so we had to cut new ones that would work with them. We also couldn't figure out the instructions as they were all out of order so we found them online (sent in the slack)",attach both sides of the chassis and attach wheels!,"Abby, Anita, Ava, Jolie, Romy, Laurel, Spencer",https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-build/mecanum-drivetrain-kit-mecanum-drivetrain
9/30/2022,Both,Teaching Chassis ,"In order to help give definitions to engineering elements and give the new team members some building experience, we started the second chassis and went over elements such as mecanum wheels, gear reductions, etc. ",The screw within was sanded down and we had to get Mr. Cox to drill it out.,Attatch the motors to the sides of the chassis and continue following the instructions to build the basic chassis with horizontal motors,Everyone else in building,https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-build/mecanum-drivetrain-kit-mecanum-drivetrain/drive-rail-assembly
9/30/2022,Both,Making wheel attachments on the lathe  ,"We need to make metal pieces to insert into the wheel so they can be attached to the robot. Mr. Cox and I streamlined/figured out the process about how to do this. Because it took a while to figure out all of the measurements and processes, we o lay completed one.

10/7/2022,Both,Lazy Susan platform,"We started constructing a lazy susan. We made a platform out of cardboard, and attatched a motor. ","The metrics on the parts were different, and the parts did not line up well. It took a while to fit the parts together.","Continue constructing lazy susan, testing spin, add grease, put motor onto the opposite side of the lazy susan from where it is now so that the arm can be connected to the metal bars (use square brackets to wrap the connection around to the top side that has the bars from the bottom side)","Alyssa, Lucie, Maya, Annie",
10/7/2022,Both,Building Chassis,We made all the L brackets for one robot. We attached all the motors and some of the wheels. ,The lazy susan is quite big - we may have to make the chassis bigger or reconfigure the motors at a future time. Or get a smaller lazy susan!,"Attach final wheels, and maybe dremel off some of the hex shafts off of the wheels. Tighten all nuts on L bracket ","Eleni, Ava, Liza, Gracie",
10/12/2022,Both,Finishing first chassis,We finished up the chassis to hand off to coding by tightening all the screws. We also 3D printed pieces to go inside of the mechanum wheels since we lost the ones that came with the kit. Made sure to print out of nylon since it is the strongest!,The middle parts of wheel printed out upside down at first so they were all melted-plastic looking. ,Hand it over to coding for wiritng and testing,"Eleni, Spencer",
10/14/2022,Both,Starting to design claw,We drew out the designs for two different claws and started to use CAD to design the lego-hand style one. We used CAD files from the official REV website to help us with measurements. ,"Measurements are very hard to figure out, especially when they were so small!",Continue designing the claw prototype and print it out to test,"Eleni, Laurel, Sofia G.","claw design, claw measurements"
10/14/2022,Both,Building Cascade Lift,Ava and Liza figured out the seesaw math. Then we all started to build the cascade lift using fishing line and  surgical tubing.

10/14/2022,Both,Building arm for lazy susan,We added chain with an idler pully to the revolute joint arm. The arm is powered by a motor that is attached to a hex shaft that rotates the gear attached to the chain.,"The chain was too long for the length of the metal flats and had too much slack, so we added an idler pulley.",Prototype claw for the arm,"Hannah, Lucie, Alyssa",geometry of circle
10/15/2022,Both,Attaching lift to chassis,"We first went over the two general robot design ideas so everyone is on the same page. Then, we attached the lift to the chassis. We needed to CAD and lasercut a special T-slot that would fit both of the pieces supporting the lift. ","We were stuck on knowing whether or not this was going to be a final design or just a protoype, we're leaning towards prototype that can be taken apart later. ",Finish attaching part to stabilize lift and attach motor with string,"Gracie, Anita, Eleni","custom double 45 degree T-slot part, robot 1 design, robot 2 design (as of now)"
10/20/2022,Both,Extra session: finishing rudimentary lift," we attached the hex shaft thing to the motor and wound the wire around that (it works, yay!) and also added some extra support T slots to the arm system. ","Not many issues, everything was fairly laid out before, just tying up loose ends (however, screwing things in can get tedious)","next steps are adding the beam to the back of the arm to further stabilize, and figuring out what to do with the battery/control hub",Spencer and Eva,
10/22/2022,Both,Mount for conrol and expansion hubs ,I laser cutted a board with holes for screws to connect it to the hubs and the chassis. ,"At first, the board was intended to go at the bottom of the chasis, and the hubs would be attached with velcro. This ended up not working because it did not provide easy access to the hubs. When I switched to a verticle board, the connections to the chassis were difficult to make because the screws tend to slide in the hex shaft.","Attatch the hubs to the board, tighten screws that attatch the board to the chassis to make it secure",Alyssa ,
10/22/2022,Both,Claw prototyping,Attached the servos to the wood piece and screwed on the claws to the servos,The servos were a little bit too close together and we had a little bit of difficulty screwing on the servos,Space out the servos more/find better fitting screws,Anna and Ava,Claw prototype 
10/22/2022,Both,Chassis building,"stabilized and put spacers in old chassis, fixed wheels so they're ready to be attached next week","we did not have a computer to CAD the pieces we needed, and we ran into a few problems with getting the spacers in as everything was not constructed perfectly square","CAD piece to attach wheels, attach motors","Julia, Spencer, Jolie, Anita, Aleena, and Caroline",
10/24/2022,Both,Finishing touches on first robot,Reprinted a new version of the servo mount/claw and attatched it to the lift. Also attached the mount for hubs to the back of the robot.,"The screws holes were not aligned perfectly to the wood, so we had to drill more.

10/28/2022,Both,starting to make new chassis,We decided to build a new chassis instead of using the old one. We cut down pieces of aluminum and put gear reductions on the motors. We also started on attaching the motors and wheels. ,"We didn't have the right size aluminum, so we cut it down. Also some of the wheels don't move the best",Attach axel to wheels and motors,Eleni and Hannah,
10/29/2022,Both,"We built a new chassi that is smaller, less chunky, and more stable ",We built the new chassi with the same design used for the other robot. ,"It was a relatively tedious process and we had to align many different parts.

11/18/2022,13620,Working on the claw prototype,"The band kept on falling off the wheels, so we tried to make the rods more parallel by drilling in another whole; however, that did not really help, as the other wheel became more unparallel. We eventually fixed it.",it took a while but it is done now,we need to find the optimal power setting in the code which will probably just be 1 so now we can start working on ecoders values for the differenet levels,"Nora, Kenna, and Emily",
11/19/2022,20409,Limit switch,"i got glued one of the limit switch pairs and brainstormed how we could attach it. we could either use two really long screws and attach on the other side with a t nut, or drill and screw in one nut then hot glue. or something else! (11/26 Update: Or we could CAD and 3D print something)","Hard to figure out how to attach it, b/c there's multiple ways to do it!",Attach limit switch to cascade lift,liza,
