9/16/2022,Both,Strategy Design Matrix and Brainstorming,"Today we started by watching the game video. We discussed our first impressions from the video and then rewatched the game video. We then discussed and defined a design matrix, and chose our criteria for rating our strategies. We then split up into three groups and brainstormed multiple strategies. We used our design matrix to calculate the scores of our strategies. Then for our top two scored strategies (groundbot and outer edge bot) we brainstormed a huge quantity of ideas, some practical, some corn-related. Our ideas are all on post it notes, grouped together on whiteboards, and are ready to be narrowed down!","With this new game concept, we had to be innovative to design around point penalties and height constraints, and also use those things to our advantage in terms of defence.
